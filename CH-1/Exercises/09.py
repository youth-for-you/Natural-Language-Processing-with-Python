#Review 2 on lists and strings.
#a. Define a string and assign it to a variable, e.g., my_string = 'My String'
#   (but put something more interesting in the string).
#   Print the contents of this variable in two ways,
#   first by simply typing the variable name and pressing enter,
#   then by using the print statement.
#b. Try adding the string to itself using my_string + my_string,
#   or multiplying it by a number, e.g., my_string * 3.
#   Notice that the strings are joined together without any spaces.
#   How could you fix this?
if __name__ == '__main__':
    my_string = 'My String'
    print(my_string)

    print((my_string + ' ') * 3)
